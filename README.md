## Setup
To run the program without any modifications, simply go into x64/debug/ and run MazeProject.exe

Otherwise, to make modifications and run, open up **MazeProject.sln** via Visual Studio. On the right side column that displays the Solution of the project, open up **MazeProject** and **Source Files**. There you can access and modify the source code. To compile and run, simply click the green arrow that says Local Windows Debugger at the top.
